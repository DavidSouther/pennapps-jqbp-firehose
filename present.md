= jQuery: Good Parts =
== Application overview ==

We''re going to use jQuery and the New York Times'' Newswire API to build a simple firehose application, that reads the Times Newswire API every few minutes and displays the latest pieces of content.

In this demo, I will show you a good layout for basic single-page javascript applications, several tools to quickly deploy these applications, and how to use jQuery and the Times API to make a complete, functional website. Finally, we''ll pull in the Twitter Bootstrap to make our app look awesome.
